# GreenCycle
Both files can be opened in MIT app inventor.

Ecofly is the initial version of what later became GreenCycle. This version includes:
-A map feature that shows users the nearest recycling bins and stations based on their location.
-Two scanners: one to determine the recyclability of an object, and another to identify the material of the object.
-A scoreboard and scoring system, which is rudimentarily implemented. Users earn points by scanning objects and confirming that they are recyclable. Once confirmed, users can click that theyâ€™ve recycled the item, and the score increases accordingly.
To motivate users, I introduced a leveling system, where the background color of the app changes as a reward for each new level reached. Levels are determined by the number of items recycled, with the goal of making recycling more engaging and interactive.

GreenCycle is the improved and expanded version of Ecofly with several additional features:
-A news and guidelines section that provides links to the latest news on recycling and detailed guidelines on how to recycle properly.
-Accessibility features: buttons that read aloud the text and scanner results, making the app usable for individuals who may have difficulty reading the on-screen text.
-Instead of a global leaderboard, I implemented a gallery feature. After scanning an item and confirming it as recyclable, users can take a picture of the item before recycling it. These photos are saved in the gallery, allowing users to track their recycling progress over time. This visual representation of their efforts is designed to further motivate users.
The leveling system and background color changes remain from Ecofly, continuing to reward users as they recycle more items.
